# Clustering-Algorithms
This repository contains the implementations of some clustering algorithms on mall customers dataset
Clustering algorithms implemented :

Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)
DBSCAN
In the code of each file their performance on mall customers data is also checked on metrics like Silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz Index
